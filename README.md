# The Arts In Our World

A project made for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

## Description

This is a Python app which allows the user to enter a phrase and it returns a NASA image with applied filters to make it look more artistic, if the image was found.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
#### Windows
If you're on windows you need a tool for unzipping archives.
#### Linux and Mac
If you want to use the app on Linux or Mac you'll have to compile the code on your own because there is an executable file available only for Windows.
You need a Python compiler and the libraries that the project uses
